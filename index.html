        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I am a student at D.Y Patil's University, 
          persuing Bachelors in Computer Engineering. 
          I'm passsionate about web-development. Apart
          from web-development, I like to create web designs and explore new
          technologies/programming languages and practice them. Besides this I can also work on photoshop and lightroom. Clicking photos of what's around is one thing I like to do.
